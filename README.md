<h1>Windows form APP c# project</h1>
<p>***A picture showing what the system looks like in reality</p>
 <img width=100% src="v-6.jpg" alt="logo"></a>
<P>It is a queue system and this system is used to organize the entry of customers to facilitate services within hospitals and facilitate patients

Where the system works as follows:

1- The patient chooses his doctor through the program through the basic machine of the system inside the hospital, which is the interface of windows form c#

2- The machine prints a sheet with information about the patient's number waiting for the doctor

3- The doctor requests from his control panel the next patient

4- The voice speaker requests the patient and the patient enters his doctor accordingly

The main device (the device that the patient orders from)
When the patient makes the request, it appears with the doctor on his control panel, which is called in the picture (pad).
The doctor presses a button called (next), and the headphone speaks the patient‚Äôs number, so the patient goes to the specified room.</p>

<p>**As we can see above, I have 200 tables in the project database 
All of them have a relationship with the main table 
Each table represents a doctor in the GUI, and each doctor represents a button 
The patient orders through it</p>
